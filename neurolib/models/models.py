class Model(abc.ABC):
  """
  An abstract class for Machine Learning Models.
  
  Classes that inherit from the abstract class Model will be seen by the client.
  Models are created through a Builder object, which in turn is endowed with an
  interface via which the client may add Nodes and Links to the Model as
  desired.
  
  There are two ways of invoking a Model.
  
  a) Default
    An instance of Model is created using a set of mandatory directives specific
    to the Model as in
      model = Model(*args, **dirs)
    Some control over the model hyperparameters is provided through the
    directives `**dirs`. The Model Builder object is automatically created.
    
  b) Custom
    The instance of Model is created through a custom Builder object
      model = Model(builder=mybuilder)
    where the custom builder object is used to declare the graphical model as
    desired by the user. This provides a lot more control over the model
    hyperparameters since each node of the Model graph can be independently
    tweaked.
    
  The Model classes should implement at the very least the following methods
  
  train(...)
  sample(...)

    suspect it is not going to cut it for our purposes. The sessions needs to be
    micromanaged...
    
    TODO: I also want to manually manage the graphs for when people want to run
    two models and compare for example.
